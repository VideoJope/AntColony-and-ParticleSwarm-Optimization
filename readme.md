# Installation Guide

1. Install the latest version of **[Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**.

2. **[*Optional*]** Set up a **[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)** to isolate the installation of required modules and packages from the global Python environment.

3. Run the following command from the project root directory to install the required modules and packages described by the `requirements.txt` file (this should be done from within the virtual environment if one was set up in the previous step): 
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the `main.py` file contained in the `/src` directory.
